# Skills-Lab-6

Sharif, Lukas, and Darian's drinking age program. 

Our program asks for the user's name and age and then outputs whether they are of legal drinking age.

### How to use
To use our program you'll need to either download jupyterhub or use the online terminal. 
You should open a terminal and then do `git clone https://github.com/darianmcginnis/Skills-Lab-6`
Open the THE CODE.ipynb file and then run it and it'll ask for your name and age to tell you if you're legally allowed to drink.
If you would like to contribute to our project send me an email to be added to our github! Then you'll be able to save your changes here and send them to github where we'll have all of ours files!
